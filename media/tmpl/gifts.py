    <p>Your presence is more than enough as a gift! We're just glad that you could make it to our big day.</p>
    
    <p>If you insist on giving us a gift, we'd love small donations to go towards our honeymoon in France and Italy.</p>
    
    <p>We're also registered for gifts at <a href="http://www.crateandbarrel.com/Gift-Registry/Natalie-Podrazik-and-Ricky-Chang/r5016204">Crate & Barrel</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/registry/wedding/790KTO6I8QHH">Amazon</a>.</p>
