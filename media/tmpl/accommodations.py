    <p class="left">The wedding ceremony and reception will be at Transmitter Park in Greenpoint, Brooklyn (see: <a href="${ROOT_URL}/map">Map</a>) at 12 noon.  It's a small, waterfront park and it will be obvious as soon as you enter where the wedding will be.</p>

<p class="left">Public transportation to and from the wedding is strongly recommended!  We are New Yorker transplants, and, for our special day, you can, too.</p>


<p class="left">New York City has many, many, many hotels. <a href="http://airbnb.com">Air B & B</a> is popular if you'd like to stay in a homey apartment as an alternative.  Ask us if you find a hotel/Air B&B and aren't sure if it's easy to take the train to our wedding. We're pretty damn good at subway optimizations by now.</a></p>

<ul class="accomo-list">

<li>Long Island City is the most convenient to Greenpoint. <a href="http://www.kayak.com/hotels/Long-Island-City,NY-c207/2013-06-07/2013-06-09">Here</a> are the kayak.com results and <a href="https://www.airbnb.com/s/Long-Island-City--Queens--NY?checkin=06%2F07%2F2013&checkout=06%2F09%2F2013&guests=2&sw_lat=40.73916676620979&sw_lng=-73.95688045251461&ne_lat=40.75399261855144&ne_lng=-73.93731105554195&search_by_map=true">these</a> are the Air B&B listings.</a> <br /><br />
To get to the wedding from Long Island City, take the <b>G</b> at the Court Square station two stops south to the Greenpoint Avenue station.</li>

</ul>

<h2 class="left">Manhattan</h2>
<ul class="accomo-list">
<li>Times Square or Grand Central typically have the best hotel deals. <a href="http://www.kayak.com/hotels/Times-Square,New-York,NY-c15830-l5515/2013-06-07/2013-06-09">Here</a> are some hotels from kayak.com and <a href="https://www.airbnb.com/s/Times-Square--New-York--NY?checkin=06%2F07%2F2013&checkout=06%2F09%2F2013&guests=2">here</a> are the listings for airbnb.com.<br /><br /> To get to the wedding from Times Square or Grand Central, take the <b>7</b> (Times Square or Grand Central Station) to  the Court Square station in Queens, then the <b>G</b> south to the Greenpoint Avenue station. </li>


    <li>Anything near 14th Street in Manhattan is an easy commute to Greenpoint. These neighborhoods include Union Square, West Village, East Village, and Flatiron (up to 23rd Street and as low as 10th Street).  <br /><br />
    To get to the wedding from those areas, walk to your nearest 14th Street subway station (from west to east: 8th Ave, 6th Ave, Union Square, 3rd Ave, 1st Ave) for the <b>L</b> train. Take the <b>L</b> to the Metropolitan/Lorimer station, the second stop in Brooklyn. Transfer to the Court Square (north-bound) <b>G</b> and get off at the Greenpoint Avenue station.</li>

</ul>

<ul class="accomo-list">
    <li>The <a href="http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60827-d2452838-Reviews-The_Box_House_Hotel-Brooklyn_New_York.html">Box Hotel</a> is within walking distance to the wedding though it is not very NYC-scenic.
    <br />
    <br />
    Walk south on Manhattan Avenue, pick up some delicious Polish sausage or baked goods, go west on Greenpoint Avenue and walk until you run into the East River.  You have arrived at Transmitter Park. </li>
    
    <li>Hotels off the <b>G</b> subway line will be your best bet to getting to the wedding.  Places in neighborhoods like Fort Greene, Park Slope, Carroll Gardens, and a few others will work.  
    <br />
    <br />
    From these neighborhoods, take a Court-Square (northbound) <b>G</b> to the Greenpoint Avenue station.</li>
